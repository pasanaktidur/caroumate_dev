# Supabase Database Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Supabase database for the Caroumate application.

## Prerequisites

- A Supabase account (sign up at https://supabase.com)
- Clerk authentication already configured

## Step 1: Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to https://app.supabase.com
2. Click "New Project"
3. Fill in your project details:
   - Name: `caroumate` (or your preferred name)
   - Database Password: Create a strong password
   - Region: Choose the closest to your users
4. Wait for the project to be created (~2 minutes)

## Step 2: Get Your API Credentials

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings** > **API**
2. Copy the following values:
   - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **anon public** key (under "Project API keys")

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. Open your `.env.local` file in the project root
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

## Step 4: Run Database Migration

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Click "New Query"
3. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
4. Paste it into the SQL editor
5. Click "Run" to execute the migration
6. You should see a success message

## Step 5: Verify Database Setup

After running the migration, verify that all tables were created:

1. Go to **Table Editor** in your Supabase dashboard
2. You should see the following tables:
   - `users`
   - `user_settings`
   - `user_stats`
   - `carousels`
   - `slides`

## Step 6: Configure Clerk Integration (Optional but Recommended)

To automatically sync Clerk users with Supabase:

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Authentication** > **Providers**
2. Enable "Custom" provider
3. The application will automatically sync users when they sign in via Clerk

## Database Schema Overview

### Tables

- **users**: Stores user profiles synced from Clerk
- **user_settings**: Stores user preferences (AI model, API keys, brand kit)
- **user_stats**: Tracks download counts and carousel counts
- **carousels**: Stores carousel metadata
- **slides**: Stores individual slide content for each carousel

### Security

The database uses Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure:
- Users can only access their own data
- Authentication is handled via Clerk JWT tokens
- All operations are scoped to the authenticated user

## Features Enabled

âœ… **Data Persistence**: All user data is stored in the cloud
âœ… **Multi-Device Sync**: Access your carousels from any device
âœ… **Automatic Backups**: Supabase handles database backups
âœ… **Real-time Updates**: Changes sync instantly (if implemented)
âœ… **Secure Access**: Row-level security protects user data

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load user data" error
- Verify your `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are correct
- Check that the migration ran successfully
- Ensure RLS policies are enabled

### Data not saving
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify you're signed in via Clerk
- Check Supabase logs in the dashboard (Logs section)

### Migration errors
- Make sure you copied the entire SQL file
- Check for syntax errors in the SQL editor
- Try running the migration in smaller chunks if needed

## Local Development vs Production

For local development, you can use the same Supabase project. For production:

1. Create a separate Supabase project for production
2. Run the same migration script
3. Update your production environment variables

## Data Migration from localStorage (Optional)

If you have existing data in localStorage that you want to migrate:

1. The application will continue to work with localStorage if Supabase is not configured
2. Once Supabase is configured, you can manually export/import data
3. A migration script can be created if needed

## Support

For issues with:
- **Supabase**: Check https://supabase.com/docs
- **Clerk Integration**: Check https://clerk.com/docs
- **Application**: Contact the development team

## Next Steps

After completing the setup:

1. Restart your development server
2. Sign in to the application via Clerk
3. Create a test carousel to verify data is being saved
4. Check the Supabase dashboard to see the data in the tables

Your Supabase database is now configured and ready to use! ðŸŽ‰
